This repository is currently a placeholder for an application that is not yet developed.  The application is intended to store user contributed levels and images and allow saving/loading of these from the Secret Chronicles game.

Feel free to create tasks under this repository in the mean time.

A reference prototype is posted at: https://github.com/Quintus/smc-addon-website.  Note that the code for this prototype will probably NOT be used in the new implementation.
